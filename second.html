        <h1> Environmental Issues in Siachen </h1> 
        <p> The glacier was uninhabited before 1984, and the presence of thousands of troops since then has introduced pollution and melting on the glacier. To support the troops, glacial ice has been cut and melted with chemicals.
            Dumping of non-biodegradable waste in large quantities and the use of arms and ammunition have considerably affected the ecosystem of the region.</p>
        <p> The various environment issues in Siachen are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Glacial Retreat</li>
            <li> Waste Dumping</li>
            <li> Fauna and Flora</li>
        </ul>
