            <p> The Siachen Glacier is a glacier located in the eastern Karakoram range in the Himalayas. It is the longest glacier in the Karakoram and second-longest in the world's non-polar areas."Sia" in the Balti language refers to the rose family plant widely dispersed in the region. "Chun" refers to any object found in abundance. Thus the name Siachen refers to a land with an abundance of roses. The entire Siachen Glacier, with all major passes, has been under the administration of India since 1984. </p>
            <p> The glacier's melting waters are the main source of the Nubra River in the Indian region of Ladakh, which drains into the Shyok River.
